    <h2>What is Margherita Pizza?</h2>
    <p>Margherita pizza hails from Naples, Italy. It features three iconic toppings:</p>
    <ol>San Marzano tomatoes</ol>
    <ol>Fresh mozzarella cheese</ol>
    <ol>Basil leaves</ol>
    <p>"According to Marcella Hazan’s cookbook <em>Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking</em>, the pizza was 
        first made for Italy’s Queen Margherita when she visited Naples in the late nineteenth century. 
        The red, white, and green toppings were patriotic, as they decorated the pizza with the colors 
        of the Italian flag."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ol><strong>Pizza dough</strong>, of course! We make our own with this pizza dough recipe. It’s easy to make with ingredients like flour, water, and yeast, and it yields a chewy, delicious pizza crust. Of course, store-bought fresh pizza dough works here too.</ol>
    <ol><strong>Canned whole tomatoes</strong> – You don’t need fresh tomatoes to make a great margherita pizza. Instead, you’ll pulse good-quality canned tomatoes into a no-cook homemade pizza sauce with olive oil, garlic, and salt. San Marzano tomatoes, a sweet variety of Italian plum tomatoes, are traditional here. Use them if you can!</ol>
    <ol><strong>Fresh mozzarella cheese</strong> – The perfect rich counterpart to the tomatoes and basil. Cut it into thin slices or tear it before topping the pizza.</ol>
    <ol><strong>Fresh basil</strong> – Its fresh flavor takes this pizza over the top! You’ll sprinkle it over the pizza after baking so that it doesn’t wilt in the oven.</ol>
    <ol><strong>Red pepper flakes</strong> – They add a kick of heat.</ol>
    <ol><strong>And extra-virgin olive oil</strong> – For rich, fruity flavor.</ol>
